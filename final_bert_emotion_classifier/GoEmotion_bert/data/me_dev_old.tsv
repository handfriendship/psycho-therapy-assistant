Realistically speaking, if they were on a VGBC channel, [NAME] would give them a nickname whenever they were on stream, and that would eventually catch on.	27	eew0rdy

You're just mad because you're starting to realize that you're reaaaaaaaaaaally close to being a [NAME].	20	edoubd3
Right on, just making sure someone wasn't trying to steal your OC	22	efglbc4

Is she worse than [NAME] though?	7	edyfdum
Lol sometimes I do feel like punching someone who I feel is whispering about me ,if I am drunk it would be very bad 😂	4	edlpy07
Because in a world of fake people you need strangers being mean to get an honest opinion.	4	edb5asu
How? They don't have SoundCloud or anything and it's usually played before you're killed.	27	ed6tkz3
Sounds like an edgy 14 yo that just had his first kiss	27	ee86paj
Pretty much. Him and [NAME] will share ball handling duties. Point Lance and Point Outlaw in the house	27	eel1onf
>They will sell us the ropes and all that. Quoting a mass murderer who especially targeted democratic socialists on the subject of preparing mass murder...	27	eeq7np2
Unless the government steps in and does something stupid	27	ecztcu6
I have nothing to say to you.	4	eezaav7
I own literally no red shirts, would grey, tan, or purplish be okay?	27	ee09cut
Yah that's what is stopping me. I would have to wire all throw my car or go into my cars electrical which doesn't seem worth it.	27	eek32qy
This is murder	27	eddg9ev
Honestly if you put it in your head that it won't it'll just be a pleasant surprise if he does	10	eduj90n
HOLY SHIT CHANCE	27	eekx665
is the entire cast at least on there and not cut off at the bottom like the other pic I saw here?	6	ed6k6b1

Ugh. [NAME] is so naughty.	2	ee6bpyw
01/11/19 - pretty easy to remember as it is the day my band released it's first full length record. The release day gig was also pretty neat!	0	eeljf6m
This was the scene that hooked me on the show.	25	edv965k
[NAME] was such a disaster at OC, I really don't feel comfortable even implying he's in Schotty's league.	10	ee50y8v
[NAME] is often regarded as strategically the worst Lord in the series because of this. [NAME]	9	eescux3
Because they're all done by the same, really, really old guy	4	eemflic
Can you imagine the [NAME] brothers getting pitched by a woman who believes in chemtrails	27	ef2lj8i
I came here once accidentally, saw your commend and now, 2 weeks later, I totally understand. 	27	edhu00c
Well, that was dumb.	3	ee3yzt5

I would feel similarly, but I would be more gleeful and less guilty. 	24	efh53cb
[NAME] that was funny too. She was mothering him the whole episode	1	eezttob
Laugh now, while you can, and the robot overlords are weak and stupid. Tomorrow, though... take a deep breath... and wait.	1	ef8yddd
let me emphasize that word *storing* not eating out of	27	ee0v2bk
Petulant child? No wonder he and [NAME] get along.	27	ee136eq
I too have had this happen on XBONE. I really want to love this game, but it keeps giving me reasons to play something else.	18	edvs1ek
I have been saying this for a long time, he is way overpaid and the forward position is our main weakness since [NAME] left. 	27	eeqq8mz
I am scared that I would lose potential study time by seeing him. And worse if I end up liking him too much... :(	14	eet0225
Thank you mate.	15	ed53r1b
just a single point	27	ediuvf9

Easy on the Granville Island gatekeeping amigo. Its absolutely a tourist destination.	17	ef1l1bj
That's what I thought (landlord myself). Even if you rent a room to someone, still that's a bit extreme.	27	effgfie
[NAME] is a moron. Why take the ball away from your best player and give arguably the best RB in the nation the chance to run it out.	2	ed1cr1q
"I'll pass the ""I'm not crying you're crying!"" part. Yeah I'm crying. "	25	ee4hcgp

What is an OL?	7	ed9ymjo
Or he could just not share your beliefs? I mean, you don’t think his ethnicity should dictate his political views, do you?	27	ed44iwn
All sound advice. I still hate the ult when it kills me by a small hair.	16	edb09e4
Similar feeling here. We'll are just bunch of weebs.	27	edg7lov
Legally, you are responsible for damage or harm done as a cop is trying to apprehend you. You caused the dangerous situation by running.	10	ef83p89
These people think a magic man in the sky watches them masturbate..... not exactly high runners in the critical thinking fields	27	eefgdfy
That’s because she went on to miss the lay up	27	edjjzwd

I didn't see anything in that comment referring to a cactus.	22	edye7va
[NAME] has only missed a couple games and WCJ hasn't missed any. Not sure how you rank their top 4.	10	edar4o7
This blows. But I think [NAME] can do it alone if he gets a home health care assistant.	20	eetauds
It'd be easier not to do it at all. I don't think it's meant to be easy.	10	ee5ng89
I have seen the movie Nosferatu. Believe it or not, I wasn’t even born when it was released!	22	edvsien
The unfortunate thing is that, right now, that **is** how it works in politics, it’s just been made extremely obvious the last few years. 	10	eejyia8
They believed in themselves, and clutched up. Let’s get it	27	eekzce0
Thats great... Here same with me	0	ee12et5

[NAME] I wish you *were* silent	5	ef37tvc
Thank you. It feels better knowing that this is not an unheard of thing.	15	eesaqkb
There was no point. This is also the answer for many other choices that have been made in the sequels	27	eedbtm2

Satire account.	27	ee70l7d
What about every series prior to that? [NAME] was awful vs the bucks [NAME] was awesome. What about the years before that?	27	eeswney
So you reject your ideology's premise that you can just protect yourself.	5	efbju81
Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. 	22	ee1k6eb

I liked going to the beach as a kid, but as soon as we were done I wanted that sand *off*. Wet sand gets *everywhere*.	27	edsa3b3
Good. It's weird that Polish gun culture is nearly non-existent, given their history as a country. Hopefully this is a step toward fixing that.	0	efgcbgt
My favourite book, the writing is beautiful. Very much a precursor to 1984.	0	ee45org

Prayer will help you more than any of us can	5	eezokgk

Agreed. A case where we're both right. Cheers!	4	eerpu6c
I’m sorry	24	ed9vdyn

Wow, after the past 2 seasons that seems like it was like 6 years ago.	17	ee87xym
Hot take: [NAME] sucked after he went away to anger management and he suddenly changed into a moron who was completely incapable of doing anything even remotely correct.	2	edm6vbw
Your entire argument is undermined by how triggered you are. Also buy a thesaurus. And not all words have power all words have meaning.	27	eet1vov
Yea. That video is garbage.	11	ed0mb05
As a non-religious that’s fascinated by [RELIGION], I love this 😅.	18	edcn2ku

Daily Wire is a hate site, and [NAME] is a bigot.	27	edqnkhu

Honestly Quadriga has been pretty decent, can't fault them for the bank struggle, that's just how the Canadian banks have been towards this space. 	3	eez4u83
"[NAME] "" haters gonna hate"" the most cringe I've seen of any politician. Worse than [NAME] benefit singing some working class song. "	2	ef8ob2i

Looks like we found his natural position.	27	eekm8q1
You're way too involved in this. Take a break from the internet.	27	eeokbv5
Funding was never the problem of Mass Effect. EA is. You're confirming their bad business strategy.	4	efcd7ns
Haha, just like teaching.	1	eeq25z4
My favorite is when he puts his name at the end of the sentence like this. It makes his comment seem so Eloquent! Best, [NAME]	0	efcv67k
> Humans are empathetic and do this daily. I have to remind myself of this sometimes.	27	ed76wz1
Isn't that exactly what the Dunning-Kruger effect is - someone over estimating their understanding / ability?	6	edkcvzt
I’m happy. Does that mean I can downvote?	10	ee6foxc
Huh, I'd missed this one when looking for new games a few months back. Might have to give it a try.	9	eemrrt5

Oh my [NAME], this is an absolute lie. 	11	eekfa9w
The way colt talks in that weird calm voice is like a psychopath. I hate it. It’s so condescending and creepy.	11	ee0o0zt
The government won't let scientists do studies on it, so we're stuck with anecdata until they stop being assholes.	27	efgolr1
"Because they claim to be against [NAME], and they need something called ""votes"" to beat him?"	3	edzn2fp

I'd heard that too, but always thought their differences were more artistic/professional than personal... Oh well, people grow apart. We still got Aquemini.	27	ednl6sw
Seems like it was supposed to be funny.	1	edimrwg
Wow. This would suck	1	eewi5ua
Ah, the movies are fine. It's pretending they're a profoundly trascendental form of art that I find ludicrously funny.	1	efeghis
Mate just go out and get yourself a steak dinner, you will enjoy it much more than Artifact.	27	edylvqw
You want me to go searching around for that? I'm good. I'll just assume you're wrong because of the way you type.	7	ed32ig0
If they could get a psychologist/therapist maybe they would have a better life.	27	edmhe3l

Yesterday I remembered that this game existed and was happy that I waited and didn't buy into a game that would be dead in a month.	17	edpfc49
mtv has agreed to take some of the load by having them on...i wonder if they get paid per appearance or flat season fee.	20	eczmb8c
