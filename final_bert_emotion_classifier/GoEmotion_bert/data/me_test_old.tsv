Meanwhile... [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] don't benefit at all from playing with better players	22	ee5029b
I love how they have it on the dog. Imagine a fur missile going after a suspect flashing red and blue.	18	eed21e5
They really need to bring [NAME] son back to do more flashback scenes of young [NAME]. That would be SO GOOD	0	eelfg23
This scene was priceless! Trash TV gold.	0	edo5jw4
12 players had points! Everyone except [NAME] had a shot on goal!	27	eeiai4e
The game will come out for the switch this year. Was wondering how they would manage the combat system. Now I know.	7	eeqr0aw

1.283 on a comment but I don't really go after normal posts for karma	3	ed3slrg
Does that idiot not realize he's roasting himself by calling [NAME] a bad lawyer? You worked with him for a decade, moron.	3	eeuzpi9
Same thing as well! I don't know what is happening.	6	eerzsvn
This is probably why you're not in a relationship.	27	eddz7so
You know it! Just gotta find the right someone.	27	edlzw0n
Many a prick, as I recall. You could track them down but then it'd be pointless. 	27	edk2nbj
If it's an unregistered payg sim then how exactly are they going to catch anyone?	7	eedecaf
Yeah, this seems weird to me, too.	27	edngdyn
This is why we love Football!!!	18	ed6h9fn
Surely you meant isn't. XD	27	eff9bb4
[NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and one of [NAME] or [NAME]. But I’m pretty sure all of [NAME] is under contract forever if that matters	27	eel5qfq
I'd almost rather a criminal have a gun than this guy.	27	ee1ka2g
WHY IS PULJUJARVI ON THE 4TH LINE?!?!?!?!?!	27	ee2aybx
What a wonderful world you lot live in!	0	ef4glcl
I will upvote any gif that has [NAME] as Dr. [NAME] in it. I loved her performance in Maniac.	18	efdl3cp
No, the teens were not being assholes. The original sentiment that spread like wildfire absolutely does not stand.	27	eem87sg
He drinks all coffee with cream. We already know he’s not above disgusting liquids.	27	eewdztl
Juve somehow still managed to get the upper hand in the [NAME] for [NAME] and [NAME] deal. That's some voodoo shit right there.	27	eepqwww
"[NAME]: ""WTF, it's just a prank bro!"""	2	edjxtrl
Also thanks to 4chan	15	ed408zp
Hello, future people!	27	ef6490d

THIS IS NOT DETROIT, MAN! THIS IS THE SUPERBOWL!	10	eelj8zb
It is his welcome, he can do with it as he wishes. Your misunderstanding is forgiven.	5	eeh6e9k
"""[NAME] will be Turkey's Vietnam"" yeah, we saw how that went lol "	1	edsjcjg
I'd enjoy a nice warm hug. Along with a delightful conversation. But that works too.	5	edvawr9
yep. And there are jobs I still would want done, they just shouldn't be government	4	eedxmug
Kinda weird to continuously shoot at Police too...	11	efberzy
No, she tried and failed lmao	10	ed28fsu
You are welcome, I have faced lot of sibling related issues. Hope things work out well for you.	20	ef5c5zn

"It's called Middle Class Syndrome. ""Bad things happen to *other people*."""	2	efgobbx
Another place Canada wins. That is crazy. There is basically no oversight on alternative medicine down here. Caveat emptor I guess.	4	efgj9q4
Definitely on how they act. Although if you put deeper thought into it, calling a woman a girl is rooted in misogyny. But context matters.	11	eep6x5q
I can never refold the paper properly so kudos just for that!	15	edxag0k
OH LAWD HE COMIN!	27	eewwuwb

I got a good laugh at this one. I feel bad.	3	eez3x25
I get abused on the daily fam ‍♀️‍♂️‍♂️‍	27	eemv729
Not evenly proportional, and not what I said. I'm talking just overall shape for proportion. I like a mom belly.... They're pretty sexy.	27	eee5gjo
nope. not hers.	27	eff11g7
I don’t think there are strippers necessarily, but it does make me question what he wants to do without me there	7	eczyr6d
ahhhhh no how dare i have morals of course the most important thing is that my favorite football team has a better special teams coordinator	17	edu9tv3
My name is [NAME]	27	edb135z
How old is this? I remember he was hugely FB popular back in like 2011. Him and [NAME].	22	eevh1zo
I'd love [NAME] to smash some faces in.	4	eetknzu
Isn't that exactly what the Dunning-Kruger effect is - someone over estimating their understanding / ability?	27	edkcvzt
It’s bad law. I wouldn’t be surprised either.	26	eeqzmin
I think I will try to push through, I guess I can always drop a class or two if it’s too much and even take a break 	20	ed2ai56

Doesn't answer the question about who is going to pick the low hanging fruit though!	9	eelqs8h
Your aunt has some damn nerve, though!	27	edmcxu7
I love all the cast in the later seasons, but the [NAME] relationship in seasons 2-4 are prime.	18	edg3po0

These people in here are joking about holding down and cutting their neighbors faces. It's pretty gross.	27	eezn7lf
It wasn’t significant.	10	edbjbr8
Yo infected turn into evil clone troopers !!!	27	eew7el1

...it’s a Homestuck reference	27	edagpsw
No she does not, not alone and not during sex(sadly) 	10	ed5ry8k
[NAME] also slept with his dads mistress, [NAME] is weird	3	ee2tthj
Get out of my head.	27	ed71ec1
Dude I don’t even know what that guys deal is, but honestly, I feel bad for him	25	edfm4j7

Toxic feminism is ti blame	2	ee60k0m
Honesty!! Rare	27	eczw4tj
Oh shit, yeah that's definitely shady.	9	ee5n26j
So satisfying chucking a spear and getting a few guys with one throw. Also I loved the bow in this game	18	ee4hhqi
What's absurd here is that anyone believes a bottle of champagne is worth 34k.	3	edkdf0i
You've been promoted to branch-manager!	27	ee0okhi
Just saw your history. Makes complete sense now. Your a trumptroll. Bye.	1	ee3t871
They wanted to hit the international domestic market. They're setting up Arcade systems now, they're currently in beta.	27	ed47v2k
I’m up here too man, having a great time so far!	27	ef299gt
Love the [NAME]. They have a great dynamic and it looks like a genuine friendship.	18	ee9uvf2
Right. He didn't even say a word. I feel like I've seen this before tho.	27	eekvv10
[NAME] is the only person I've heard acknowledge that [NAME] hasn't been all that great on defence this year. Which is kinda true	27	efdih24
People do realize that getting an ad declined for the Super Bowl is an actual advertising strategy, right?	7	eep8qpu
Are you in love with the memories or do you still love him for who he is now?	6	ed3chq4
go on, it's not like your Ni is, 100% accurate, what is my type?	27	ed3u8fl
Your question was is 4.2 inch small for an erect penis, my answer is yes it is. 	27	eeduazj
I mean there's a pretty big community of people that idolize school shooters and rapists so you never know on the internet.	26	ee3squu
Yeah I should rephrase. If you are from *anywhere in the world* and you are a [NAME]...	27	ef1rc46
I don't think it's that simple. There was a lot riding on making 7 and taking too many risks probably isn't the best answer.	4	ed8kg4l
I know and I really genuinely wish there was something I could do or say to help you take this pain away and to help you feel better.	8	ed9v2fq
Yeah, that would be one value combo he would shove that she is beating.	27	edkc1zh
I like how he just watches as it happens too, reminds me of what a cat would do.	22	ees56r2
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself. Just relax, take a deep breath, let the blood flow. Everything's going to be fine.	20	ed9042l
I thought you were just going to wait her out. You actually engineered her loss of space to someone else. WELL DONE!!!!	0	ef7jkmz
[NAME] still the best dev tho. Nice nonsense comparison btw.	3	eez7bex
The dress was trailer trash appropriate. Did he just run out of money for a good dress? I mean, $300 BLACK UNDIES.	26	ed84cls
[NAME] himself erased your memory of him screwing up. You shouldn't take these kind of things for granite.	10	edv9f4v
Collab on the way?	6	edehlra
She called someone from RHONJ a r****d and then doubled down in a particularly petulant manner when someone called her out	27	eecnsly

Still love [NAME]. Gave his heart to the Broncos for many years. Hope he can go out and win himself another ring this year.	18	ee9khqj
Russian prostitutes are overblown. It's not even that common. There isn't really any widespread negative perceptions about [NAME] in South Korea.	27	eeizm0i
Then he should have had his head up. This is hockey, not figure skating. Great hit! I miss that kind of contact in the game.	27	eed6mfq
Its horrifying to think about getting separated from your family, friends and the culture you were living into somewhere new and unfamiliar just like that	9	eeru9om
I laughed way harder then i shouldve	17	ef0nh59
That tiny shoulder pad is freaking adorable.	0	eechsax

I can answer this! It's alright. Interesting little snippets that make me curious about the show for sure.	4	ed2w9nf
So he “wants to be in Denver”. Hooray. Can we hire the best guy instead?	0	ede4tyv

Same with [NAME], she’s simply stunning at any age. 	0	ee3f5km
It's legal now in quite a few states. People get booze for Christmas all the time. I'd be stoked.	4	edhrir1
Thanks for sharing that info. I'll see how low I can go. Did you do a trade in?	15	edrzvs2
Id be pretty pissed if my prime didn't auto renew	3	ed7bxkx
Nope. That’s a really inaccurate, misleading headline.	27	edw2uw4
...i love [NAME] for what she did/does for her [NAME]. ...also, would like to see some of the work that comes out of the collective	18	edpgwl1

Imperial is already messy and hard to understand	9	ee9kxwt
I assumed that came from him brandishing a firearm at the kids after they egged his car.	27	ee2chrm
Next time something like this happens tell them it's illegal to pet a working service dog and they could be sent to jail for it	2	eeq3twb
Yes. Get used to it, it's not going away soon.	4	ef4nhzn
Thanks all. It was a league game in our local bar. The dealer rotates on each hand. Lesson learned from me.	15	edw7yom
Yup, the cammer is at fault here.	27	eehji3d
Shame ,your quite cute 	0	ed51u06
“[NAME], I tried to make ramen in the coffee pot and I broke everything” - [NAME]	27	ed19k48
100%. This is made up. If her claim was true, she'd have it on video. 	27	eezav9m
Thanks I will check that out.	15	edzvr1p
[NAME] killed him and was only in for like 5 minutes...	4	eeet2ri
That’s an interesting point, thank you.	15	efgg8w6
You absolutely dodged a bullet. You can be sad about it because it sucks to be broken up with but you def dodged a bullet.	27	ef7hxke
she got knocked the f out!	27	ee8t8iy
I mean, your account is a day old, so I think you’ll be okay.	27	eexqh0l
Yeah, might just grab a coffee and be done with it.	4	ed80uhh
But little [NAME] might grow up to be one of them, no?	7	efa2xcz
Not sure who to side with now	6	efedrno
But how the— what the— wait, why would—fuck it, I’m out. 	2	eeauy6j

As a contractor this is a huge nono. If it's not on paper it not on your wall either.	6	eetiq43
My sister squeezed a lime in her milk when she was 12. Same thing happened, but we told her it would happen AFTER she did it ..	1	ed2hsq3
Obviously has played on her mind for that long... glad she apologised	17	edb3xew
Try not to mix too much. It will get overwhelming and you'll just end up with bad trips.	4	edjhfht
"Submissive? ""she’s a [NAME] so literally it’s like a brand new car [NAME] has blessed me with."" You're disgusting."	1	een7cjm
Then spend already! Go get [NAME] and [NAME] and [NAME]. Bring up that young talent and dominate already.	20	eegrx15
I have a long term plan. I appreciate the concern.	4	ee4h4cu
Bless your heart	27	edaqgt5
not my kid, not my problem. Best comeback ever xD	10	ef0hx65
I'm pretty sure the armor still shows on the person after you kill them even if it is broken.	27	ed72oa1
I don't know, but there's probably a word for it in German.	6	ee8t50i
Thanks. I needed this reminder today.	15	eea69xu
Can anyone tell me what happened to [NAME]?	27	eczgflv
[NAME] just has to wait a few hundred years	27	eevw2rl
Alot of friends and family make that or less. It's pretty crazy.	27	edn2wmd
My crazy idea ... join the PAC-12 in a combined bid with Boise State football. You all would dominate.	27	eej7icr
Thanks for clarifying; I've never heard this (it's not a pejorative where I live) so it's good to know.	15	eepx74n
Prime video has office and 4 has community. Shoot me now.	27	eekhyj3

I love Big Brother, they make an appointment and come pick up used household goods and clothes. Easiest way to donate.	5	edm0qmw
[NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and one of [NAME] or [NAME]. But I’m pretty sure all of [NAME] is under contract forever if that matters	27	eel5qfq
Aw :(	17	ed709l2
For real! So happy they just put season 2 on hulu	17	ef7i92j

Oblivion's world was pretty generic [NAME] fantasy, which dropped it down a peg for me, compared with Morrowind's incredibly unique, alien world.	4	edohreo
